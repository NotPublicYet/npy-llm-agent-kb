## Summary
<h2>What's changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Claude automatically saves useful context to auto-memory. Manage with /memory</li>
<li>Added <code>/copy</code> command to show an interactive picker when code blocks are present, allowing selection of individual code blocks or the full response.</li>
<li>Improved "always allow" prefix suggestions for compound bash commands (e.g. <code>cd /tmp &amp;&amp; git fetch &amp;&amp; git push</code>) to compute smarter per-subcommand prefixes instead of treating the whole command as one</li>
<li>Improved ordering of short task lists</li>
<li>Improved memory usage in multi-agent sessions by releasing completed subagent task state</li>
<li>Fixed MCP OAuth token refresh race condition when running multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously</li>
<li>Fixed shell commands not showing a clear error message when the working directory has been deleted</li>
</ul>
