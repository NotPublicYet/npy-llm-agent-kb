## Summary
<h2>What's changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>/simplify</code> and <code>/batch</code> bundled slash commands</li>
<li>Fixed local slash command output like /cost appearing as user-sent messages instead of system messages in the UI</li>
<li>Project configs &amp; auto memory now shared across git worktrees of the same repository</li>
<li>Added <code>ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false</code> env var to opt out from making claude.ai MCP servers available</li>
<li>Improved <code>/model</code> command to show the currently active model in the slash command menu</li>
<li>Added HTTP hooks, which can POST JSON to a URL and receive JSON instead of running a shell command</li>
<li>Fixed listener leak in bridge polling loop</li>
<li>Fixed listener leak in MCP OAuth flow cleanup</li>
<li>Added manual URL paste fallback during MCP OAuth authentication. If the automatic localhost redirect doesn't work, you can paste the callback URL to complete authentication.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak when navigating hooks configuration menu</li>
<li>Fixed listener leak in interactive permission handler during auto-approvals</li>
<li>Fixed file count cache ignoring glob ignore patterns</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in bash command prefix cache</li>
<li>Fixed MCP tool/resource cache leak on server reconnect</li>
<li>Fixed IDE host IP detection cache incorrectly sharing results across ports</li>
<li>Fixed WebSocket listener leak on transport reconnect</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in git root detection cache that could cause unbounded growth in long-running sessions</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in JSON parsing cache that grew unbounded over long sessions</li>
<li>VSCode: Fixed remote sessions not appearing in conversation history</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition in the REPL bridge where new messages could arrive at the server interleaved with historical messages during the initial connection flush, causing message ordering issues.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak where long-running teammates retained all messages in AppState even after conversation compaction</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak where MCP server fetch caches were not cleared on disconnect, causing growing memory usage with servers that reconnect frequently</li>
<li>Improved memory usage in long sessions with subagents by stripping heavy progress message payloads during context compaction</li>
<li>Added "Always copy full response" option to the <code>/copy</code> picker. When selected, future <code>/copy</code> commands will skip the code block picker and copy the full response directly.</li>
<li>VSCode: Added session rename and remove actions to the sessions list</li>
<li>Fixed <code>/clear</code> not resetting cached skills, which could cause stale skill content to persist in the new conversation</li>
</ul>

Implication: Potentially relevant for our LLM/Agent roadmap, and should be triaged for question/eval updates.

## Evidence/Quotes (short)
- Source URL only. Add short excerpts during triage if needed.

## Relevance to NPY
TBD

## Suggested Action
- Triage into 09_resources/news/
- Add question: 01_questions/...
- Add experiment: 03_experiments/...
