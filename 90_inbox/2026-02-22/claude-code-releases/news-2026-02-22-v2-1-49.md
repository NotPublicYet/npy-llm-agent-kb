## Summary
<h2>What's changed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Ctrl+C and ESC being silently ignored when background agents are running and the main thread is idle. Pressing twice within 3 seconds now kills all background agents.</li>
<li>Fixed prompt suggestion cache regression that reduced cache hit rates.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>plugin enable</code> and <code>plugin disable</code> to auto-detect the correct scope when <code>--scope</code> is not specified, instead of always defaulting to user scope</li>
<li>Simple mode (<code>CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE</code>) now includes the file edit tool in addition to the Bash tool, allowing direct file editing in simple mode.</li>
<li>Permission suggestions are now populated when safety checks trigger an ask response, enabling SDK consumers to display permission options</li>
<li>Sonnet 4.5 with 1M context is being removed from the Max plan in favor of our frontier Sonnet 4.6 model, which now has 1M context. Please switch in /model.</li>
<li>Fixed verbose mode not updating thinking block display when toggled via <code>/config</code> — memo comparators now correctly detect verbose changes</li>
<li>Fixed unbounded WASM memory growth during long sessions by periodically resetting the tree-sitter parser</li>
<li>Fixed potential rendering issues caused by stale yoga layout references</li>
<li>Improved performance in non-interactive mode (<code>-p</code>) by skipping unnecessary API calls during startup</li>
<li>Improved performance by caching authentication failures for HTTP and SSE MCP servers, avoiding repeated connection attempts to servers requiring auth</li>
<li>Fixed unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions caused by Yoga WASM linear memory never shrinking</li>
<li>SDK model info now includes <code>supportsEffort</code>, <code>supportedEffortLevels</code>, and <code>supportsAdaptiveThinking</code> fields so consumers can discover model capabilities.</li>
<li>Added <code>ConfigChange</code> hook event that fires when configuration files change during a session, enabling enterprise security auditing and optional blocking of settings changes.</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by caching MCP auth failures to avoid redundant connection attempts</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by reducing HTTP calls for analytics token counting</li>
<li>Improved startup performance by batching MCP tool token counting into a single API call</li>
<li>Fixed <code>disableAllHooks</code> setting to respect managed settings hierarchy — non-managed settings can no longer disable managed hooks set by policy (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="3958787008" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26637" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26637/hovercard" href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/26637">#26637</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed <code>--resume</code> session picker showing raw XML tags for sessions that start with commands like <code>/clear</code>. Now correctly falls through to the session ID fallback.</li>
<li>Improved permission prompts for path safety and working directory blocks to show the reason for the restriction instead of a bare prompt with no context</li>
</ul>

Implication: Potentially relevant for our LLM/Agent roadmap, and should be triaged for question/eval updates.

## Evidence/Quotes (short)
- Source URL only. Add short excerpts during triage if needed.

## Relevance to NPY
TBD

## Suggested Action
- Triage into 09_resources/news/
- Add question: 01_questions/...
- Add experiment: 03_experiments/...
